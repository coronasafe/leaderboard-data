Search for : facilities / patients / assets\r\n2. location : Delhi/city"

I am currently facing an issue in the issue, if we want to differentiate between the tabs which on the basis of data if they contain or not then we may have to fetch all their corresponding data at once when the page loads, because the tabs are requesting for data when they are active.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me is it the way to solve the issue or there is some other method too for it?\r\n\r\n"
