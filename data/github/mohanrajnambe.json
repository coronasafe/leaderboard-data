      "text": "@rithviknishad @aparnacoronasafe \r\nI would like to propose two solutions for this\r\nSolution 1: disable the select when the result option array is empty and show the placeholder of 'No option available'. Also, handle the option length logic in the select component. so that Listbox.Options will not be rendered if empty array is passed for options. \r\nSolution 2: In the SelectMenuV2 component, do a check for the options array length and render the ListBox.Options with passed values when it is not empty and show 'No option found' disabled option in the ListBox when it is empty. \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this."
